          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p>Counseling Therapy was founded in 2005 with a simple mission: to provide accessible, high-quality mental health services to individuals from all walks of life. What began as a small practice with just three therapists has grown into a comprehensive mental health center with multiple locations and a diverse team of professionals.</p>
          <p>Our founder, Dr. Emily Johnson, established Counseling Therapy after recognizing the need for a more holistic, client-centered approach to mental health care. She envisioned a practice where clients would feel safe, respected, and empowered to make positive changes in their lives.</p>
          <p>Today, we continue to uphold Dr. Johnson's vision by combining evidence-based therapeutic techniques with compassionate care that acknowledges the unique experiences and needs of each client.</p>
